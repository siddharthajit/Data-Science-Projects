k means clustering:
k means clustering is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that groups n different observations into k unique clusters where k < n. 
The algorithm clusters data points of similar features based on some parameter, usually Euclidean distance. Clusters are formed 
in a way to maximize inter cluster similarity. This can be achieved by minimizing within cluster sum of squares,defined as
 
 
K means algorithm requires the practitioner to enter the value of parameter k. The optimum value of k can be chosen based on sum 
of squared error (SSE) or advanced statistical measures such as gap statistic. 

Nonetheless, analytical methods often result in complicated clusters. Since, clustering requires human interpretation to make 
conclusions
The k means algorithm presented in the paper employed euclidean distance for clustering. The parameter k was set to 5 for two 
reasons. First, DBSCAN algorithm gave the best results for k = 5. Second, cluster sizes were comparable making it easier to interpret 
similarities. The dataset used is very sparse and high dimensional in nature. Generally, distance based clustering algorithms 
performs quite poorly on such datasets. One reasonable explanation for the former statement is the exponential increase 
in euclidean distance as dimension grows. Principal component analysis was used for dimension reduction to minimize the effect 
of curse of dimensionality. However, it was still difficult to understand the association between movies. Some observable patterns 
exist between movies belonging to the same cluster but these patterns cannot be generalized for all the data points in the cluster.
